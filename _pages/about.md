I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Economics at USI, under the supervision of [Antonietta Mira](https://search.usi.ch/it/persone/f8960de6d60dd08a79b6c1eb20b7442b/mira-antonietta). I completed my PhD in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Padova](https://www.stat.unipd.it), advised by Professor Bruno Scarpa. I spent a year as a visiting research scholar at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and his research group.
