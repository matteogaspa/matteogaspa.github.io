I am a PhD student in Statistical Sciences at the [University of Padova](https://www.stat.unipd.it), advised by Professor Bruno Scarpa. I spent a year as a visiting research scholar at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/) and his research group.
